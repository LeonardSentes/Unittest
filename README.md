# Explanation 
A) It tests how much the multiplication of the width and length equals, it tests if the perimeter is two time the width and the length, it tests if the width is bigger than the length.
The scenario I tested was the width and length both equal 2.0 so the results I expect to see are the following:
That area equals 4.0
That perimeter equals 8.0
And since width and length are both equal, I excepted for the function to return False.
C) Software quality is not guaranteed because we did not test every single possible scenario.
D) The scenario I have applied to Unittest is that width and length are both equal to 2.0.
